2. Navigate to the "Proxy" tab.
3. Enable the proxy and enter the required details (proxy server, port, etc.).

Proper proxy configuration ensures seamless API requests within restricted network environments.

## Importing and Exporting Data

Postman allows you to import and export data to facilitate sharing and backup:

- **Import**: Bring in collections, environments, and data from files or URLs.
- **Export**: Save your collections and environments to share with others or for backup purposes.

To import or export data, use the "Import" and "Export" options in the application.

## Sending API Requests

With Postman, you can craft and send various types of API requests:

1. **Create a New Request**: Click the "New" button and select "Request."
2. **Enter Request Details**:
   - **Method**: Choose from GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
   - **URL**: Enter the endpoint URL.
   - **Headers**: Add necessary headers.
   - **Body**: Include data for POST or PUT requests.
3. **Send the Request**: Click the "Send" button to execute.

Postman displays the response, including status codes, headers, and body content.

## Testing APIs and Writing Scripts

Enhance your API workflows by writing scripts in Postman:

Postman uses JavaScript for scripting, allowing for dynamic request modifications and automated testing.
